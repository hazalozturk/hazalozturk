      <p class="pt-5">
        I am a front end developer based in Upstate NY who is passionate about
        re-usable, accessible, and responsive software products. After spending
        4 years in research, I have retired from Chemsitry with a MS degree and
        I have started learning programming. I have now over two years of
        development experience in JavaScript, working with incredible people. I
        am a developer during the day and an abstract Artist after 5pm. I
        balance my techy personality with my creative perspective. I have worked
        more than 5 React projects, 2 Laravel projects and 3 Vue projects so
        far. I have created 10 exhibition flyers and designed many ads.
