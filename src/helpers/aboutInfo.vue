      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="pt-5">
        I am a creative developer based in NYC, who is passionate about
        re-usable, accessible, elegant and responsive digital experiences. After
        spending 4 years in research, I have retired from Chemistry with a
        Master's degree and I have started learning programming. I have now over
        three years of development experience in JavaScript, building responsive
        web applications as well as mobile applications. Over the last couple
        years, I delivered many software products to a wide range of clientele.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides building software products, I also have created many exhibition
        flyers, designed many ads, maintained couple social media campaigns and
        I have been proudly serving as a board member for Albany Center Gallery.
      </p>
      <p>
        I balance my techy personality with my creative perspective. I am a
        developer during the day and an
        <span class="artist font-weight-bold">abstract artist</span> after
        5:00pm.
