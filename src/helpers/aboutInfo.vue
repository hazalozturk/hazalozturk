      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="pt-5">
        I am a creative developer based in NYC, who is passionate about
        re-usable, accessible, and responsive software products. After spending
        4 years in research, I have retired from Chemistry with a Master's
        degree and I have started learning programming. I have now over three
        years of development experience in JavaScript, building responsive web
        applications as well as mobile applications. Over the last couple years,
        I delivered many software products to a wide range of clientele.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have created many exhibition flyers, designed many ads,
        maintaiened couple social media campaigns and I have been proudly
        serving as a board member for Albany Center Gallery.
      </p>
      <p>
        I balance my techy personality with my creative perspective. I am a
        developer during the day and an
        <span class="artist font-weight-bold">abstract artist</span> after
        5:00pm.
