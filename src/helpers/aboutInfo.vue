      <p class="pt-5">
        I am a front end developer based in Upstate NY, who is passionate about
        re-usable, accessible, and responsive software products. After spending
        4 years in research, I have retired from Chemistry with a Master's degree and
        I have started learning programming. I have now over two years of
        development experience in JavaScript, building responsive web applications
        as well as mobile applications. Despite my short 2 years journey in programming, 
        I delivered many software products to a wide range of clientele.
        I also have created many exhibition flyers, designed many ads and I have been proudly serving
        as a board member for a local art gallery. I balance my techy personality with my creative 
        perspective. I am a developer during the day and an abstract artist after 5:00pm.
